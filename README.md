# iptfup

This script tries to prevent fuck-ups when setting a new iptables firewall rule, such as one that blocks your very connection to the server you're adding it to.

## Installation

Clone this repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/e-caste/iptfup`  
Add these lines to your shell's rc file (e.g. ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):  
```
# add repository to PATH
PATH=$PATH:/the/path/where/you/have/cloned/the/repo
# enable iptables fuck-up prevention
alias iptables="sudo iptfup iptables"
alias iptables-restore="sudo iptfup iptables-restore"
```
Done âœ…

## Usage

Simply use `iptables <new firewall rule or policy>`. The iptables fuck-up prevention will come in handy if you ever make a mistake that would be irreparable without it. 

Also supported:  
- `iptables -L` to list all the currently active rules
- `iptables -F` to remove all the current rules
- `iptables-restore < /path/to/iptables.rules` to restore a ruleset from a file

The script also support saving rules directly to an arbitrary path without saving them to a temporary file first and then moving them to the desired location. The syntax is slightly different from the official `iptables-save`:

`iptables-save /path/to/iptables.rules`

If the file already exists a backup copy is created with the same name and the `.iptfup-backup` extension. If the backup file already exists it gets overwritten.
